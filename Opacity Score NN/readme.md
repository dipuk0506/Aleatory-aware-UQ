1. Computing opacity score for a sample from training posteriors is computation extensive.
2. Therefore, we train a shallow NN to predict scores.
3. Error of NN is less than 2%, bringing a highly accurate score.
4. That model needs to be separately trained for different FC layer/pre-trained models.
